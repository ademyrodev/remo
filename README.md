# Remo

Remo is an interpreted high-level programming language designed **for fun**.

Feel free to contribute!
If you have any question about the language, feel free to ask it in **``Issues``**.

Or you can go to the "examples" folder for a few examples (there are only a few).

Currently, the disassembler and bytecode chunks have been implemented.
